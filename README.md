Face Recognition Attendance System
This project implements a Face Recognition System using OpenCV to automatically identify individuals and mark their attendance. The system captures facial images, processes them in real-time, and logs the recognized individuals' attendance in a CSV file for record-keeping.

Features:
Real-Time Face Detection: Identifies and recognizes faces using OpenCVâ€™s facial recognition algorithms.
Automatic Attendance Logging: Records attendance by logging recognized faces into a CSV file for easy management and tracking.
Efficient Performance: Optimized for real-time processing, ensuring accurate detection in varying environmental conditions.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides a simple and intuitive interface for ease of use in classroom or office settings.

How It Works

The system captures images from a webcam, processes them to detect faces, and matches them with previously registered faces. When a match is found, the corresponding name is logged in the CSV file along with the timestamp of the attendance.
